# MRS_processing_scripts
Various scripts uploaded depending on the MRI scanner used by the site.
Each of the scripts labelled 'matlab1_XXXX' is unique to the fileformat of the scanner.
  - These scripts also run a matlab program called Gannet2.0, which needs to be downloaded for them to work
  - The other scripts (the ones without the matlab1_XXXX labelling, do not require gannet).
